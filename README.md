# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

A lot of people who use the internet have some form of disability. Just because someone needs to access information in a different way doesn't mean they don't deserve to have that information available to them. Acessibility on the web is something we can provide through our code to the consumer. We can use our programming skills to make the web more accessible to people who have visual or verbal impairment, cognitive issues, or physical restraints when it comes to using websites. It is important to know how to make your websites accessible so that no one gets left behind.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

There are many ways you can make your website accessible but I am going to give three examples. For someone who is visually impaired you can provid text descriptions of the images you add so when they are using the text to speech option they will know what imagry was used. You can also make sure your website gives users enough time to read and use the content on your website, not everyone can digest information at the same speed. It is also a good idea to make your website respond in predictable ways. Do not make your website so hard to navigate that it leaves some people feeling lost or unwelcome.

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

The concept of a variable is not a simple one. Essentially, a variable holds reusable data in a program and associates it with a name. If you haven't coded before it seems like an amorphous concept but they are very useful and you will be using them a lot. 

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

When you are writing code you are working with a lot of data and a huge part of your job is to make that data usable and understandable. Functions are helpful in this goal because it is a 'piece' of code that you can use multiple times without having to rewrite it every time. Functions help us to break down a large problem into smaller, more managable pieces. 

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?

There are two main ways to access data inside an object, dot notation and bracket notation. To access a key in an object inside an array you would need to use either dot notation or bracket notation in cojuction with referencing the index of your oject in the array and then the key. 

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Go into canvas and connect your reop to codegrade
3. Clone your forked version of the repo
4. DO NOT CREATE A BRANCH. You will be pushing your changes to the main/master today
NOTE: tests will run in the JavaScript portion of this challenge only.
5. cd into your repo
6. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
7. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
8. Complete your work making regular commits to main/ master your codegrade score will update each time you make a push.


### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
